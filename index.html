        <p>to have this kind of photo was something special. If only I could go back there, 
            I wanted to tell her to be strong, happy and independent.

        <h2>First communion</h2>
        <p>I've always treasured memories in photos, and there was something about 
            this particular one that I couldn't explain. I get so enthusiastic throughout the mass, God knows.

        <p>As a first-time concertgoer, the gifted group that I listened for decades as they 
            filled my early experiences is a memory that I would like to cherish always.</p>

        <h2>Senior High Graduation</h2>
        <p>It passed quickly. Senior high school life wasn't easy, as our parents had said, but we had to cherish many of 
            the memories we made because college was waiting for us.</p>
